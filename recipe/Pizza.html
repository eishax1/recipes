    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce (preferably San Marzano tomatoes, crushed)</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong>Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll or stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pizza:</strong>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange the mozzarella slices on top of the sauce.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pizza:</strong>Carefully slide the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes until slightly browned</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
    </ol>
